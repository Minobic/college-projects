    <p>Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale; Marathi pronunciation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Marathi" target="_blank">[ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]</a>; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680<sup>[5]</sup>) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.<sup>[6]</sup> Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire" target="_blank">Maratha Empire</a>. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
    <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" target="_blank">Mughal Empire</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Golkonda" target="_blank">Sultanate of Golkonda</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Bijapur" target="_blank">Sultanate of Bijapur</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_India" target="_blank">European colonial powers</a>. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Navy" target="_blank">Maratha navy</a>. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language" target="_blank">Marathi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit" target="_blank">Sanskrit</a> languages, replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language" target="_blank">Persian</a> in court and administration.<sup>[7][8]</sup></p>
    <p>Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly tow centuries after his death, he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of India independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindu.<sup>[9][10]</sup></p>
